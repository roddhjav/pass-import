## [3.0] - 2020-04-26

It is the second major rewrite of pass-import. pass import was originally
written as a wrapper for a few scripts to import passwords to password-store.
Then, in version `2.0`, a first full rewrite has been done. pass-import was
a small python script that can natively import password to pass.

From `v3.0`, pass-import became a real python program that can be used as it
or as a library to import passwords. It also supports more than pass as a
targeted password manager.


### Added
- pass-import is now password manager agnostic, meaning it is not linked to
  password-store anymore. More destination password manager support will be
  added in future releases. In this release, it supports the following
  destination password manager:
  * `keepass`
  * `csv`
  * and also to `pass`.

- For a given manager name, pass-import automatically detects the format of the
  file to import and uses the importer accordingly.
- pass-import can file encrypted by one of the supported algo before to import it.
- pass import is now available in three way:
  * As a `pass` extension `pass import`
  * As an independent command line program: `pimport`
  * As a python library `pass_import`

- Added support for the following password managers:
  * Bitwarden (json)
  * Clipperz (html)
  * Dashlane (json)
  * Freeotp+ (json)
  * Padlock (csv)
  * Passman (csv and json)
  * Passpack (csv)
  * Saferpass (csv)
  * Zoho (csv)

- Added Debian packaging.
- Added pip packaging.

### Changed
- The command line interface changed completely. See `pass import -h`
- The old password manager name are not valid anymore
- Removed old bash tests
- Dropped support for python 3.4 & python 3.5
- Implement changing of CSV delimiter character [#88](https://github.com/roddhjav/pass-import/pull/88)
- Handle field names of Revelation entry types other than Generic [#82](https://github.com/roddhjav/pass-import/pull/82)
- Better entry name deduplication [#81](https://github.com/roddhjav/pass-import/pull/81)

### Fixed
- Fixed errored error message when missing optional dependencies [#97](https://github.com/roddhjav/pass-import/issues/97)
- Use human dates for AppleKeychain [#85](https://github.com/roddhjav/pass-import/pull/85)
- Handle missing pif web form field name
- Do not interpret password names as flags [#93](https://github.com/roddhjav/pass-import/pull/93)

  * AndOTP for:
    - password encrypted backup,
    - plain text backup,
    - GPG encrypted backup.
